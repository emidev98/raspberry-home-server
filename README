# Introduction

The proposal of this documentation is to expose the necessity to create this project and why I chose all the config.
On this repository you can find all the documentation from installation to full config on my Raspberry Pi comand by comand.

# Necessity 

I wanted to have a server to be able to **host websites, deploy websites, store files, have access to the servers cli and tunneling connections**. 
All this features must be available in **local network and internet**. Preferable using a **domainname** when I connect from internet.
One of the most important things for this project is to don't have to spend money on software or services. The unique cost of this project must be the **Raspberry Pi, electricity and internet connection**.
